    With CAMARA Connectivity Insights, application developers gain essential
    visibility into network quality. This enables them to make informed
    decisions that enhance the end-user experience for their applications.

    # Introduction
      The Connectivity Insights API allows an application developer to ask
      the network the likelihood that an application's networking
      requirements can be met for a given end user session.

      This information helps a developer ensure their end users are able to
      get the best experience while using the application over their current
      network.

      Depending on the answer the network gives, the developer may decide to
      request a network boost (via the CAMARA QoD API) , and/or apply
      specific changes on the application side e.g. adjusting the
      resolution of the video stream upwards or downwards.


    # API functionality

    Prerequisite: authorisation and authentication

    Usage:
      1. create an application profile using the Connectivity Insights
      `application-profiles` API
      2. Request: POST `check-network-quality`, passing the
      `applicationProfileId` obtained in step 1, the address/port of an
      application server, and at least one device identifier.
      3. Response: The network will indicate whether it can or cannot meet
      the application requirements.
      3. Optional: use the `connectivity-insights-subscriptions` API to receive
      notifications of network quality.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `device` object, which therefore MUST be provided.

    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ## Error handling:
    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same device is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

        The developer can choose to provide the below specified device
        identifiers:

        * `ipv4Address`
        * `ipv6Address`
        * `phoneNumber`
        * `networkAccessIdentifier`

        NOTE1: the MNO might support only a subset of these options. The
        API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across
        different MNOs. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same
        device.
        NOTE2: for the Commonalities release v0.4, we are enforcing that the
        networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing,
        and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA
        meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved,
        its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

        (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device
        (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from
        some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is
        not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both
        publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its
        publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6
        address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one
        of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known.
        In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4
        address alone.
