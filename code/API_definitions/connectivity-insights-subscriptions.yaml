    With CAMARA Connectivity Insights, application developers gain essential
    visibility into network quality. This enables them to make informed
    decisions that enhance the end-user experience for their applications.

    # Introduction
      The Connectivity Insights API allows an application developer to ask
      the network the likelihood that an application's networking
      requirements can be met for a given end user session.

      This information helps a developer ensure their end users are able to
      get the best experience while using the application over their current
      network.

      Depending on the answer the network gives, the developer may decide to
      request a network boost (via the CAMARA QoD API) , and/or apply
      specific changes on the application side e.g. adjusting the
      resolution of the video stream upwards or downwards.


    # Relevant terms and definitions

      * **Identifier for the device**:
        At least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four
         options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access
          Identifier assigned by the mobile network operator for the device.

      * **Identifier for the application server**:
        IPv4 and/or IPv6 address of the application server
        (application backend)

      * **Notification URL and token**:
        Developers may provide a callback URL on which notifications can be
         received from the service provider. This is an optional parameter.

    # API functionality


      Following diagram shows the interaction between different components
      ![Sequence Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camaraproject/ConnectivityInsights/r2.2/documentation/API_documentation/ConnectivityInsights-SequenceDiagram.png)

    ### Notification callback

    This endpoint describes the event notification received on subscription
    listener side when the event occurred. As for subscription, detailed
    description of the event notification is provided in the CAMARA API design
    guideline document.

    **WARNING**: This callback endpoint must be exposed on the listener side as
    `POST /{$request.body#/sink}` will be posted by the connectivity insights
    resource server to the webhook url provided by notification listener.

    ### Data Minimization

      #### phoneNumber presence:
      These rules apply for subscription:

      - If 3-legged access token is used, the POST and GET{id} requests &
      responses must NOT provide thev``phoneNumber``. For GET (list) only
      subscription(s) for this exactly phone number is/are retrieved (implicit
      filtering).
      - If 2-legged access token is used, for POST and GET{id}, the presence
      of``phoneNumber`` in the request & response is mandatory. For GET (list)the device identifier (``phoneNumber``) could be used as filtering criteria.

      #### sinkCredential presence:

      ``sinkCredential`` is only present in POST request and not provided in
      POST or GET response.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of
    the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will
    be identified from the optional `phoneNumber` identifier, which therefore
    MUST be provided.
    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional
    `phoneNumber` identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be
    uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged
    access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is
    associated with the access token and was identified during the
    authentication process.

    ## Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the
    optional `phoneNumber` identifier is not included in the request, then the
    server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional
    `phoneNumber` identifier is also included in the request, then the server
    will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This
    will be the case even if the same device is identified by these two
    methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

        The developer can choose to provide the below specified device
        identifiers:

        * `ipv4Address`
        * `ipv6Address`
        * `phoneNumber`
        * `networkAccessIdentifier`

        NOTE1: the MNO might support only a subset of these options. The
        API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across
        different MNOs. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same
        device.
        NOTE2: for the Commonalities release v0.4, we are enforcing that the
        networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing,
        and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA
        meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved,
        its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

        (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device
        (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from
        some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is
        not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both
        publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its
        publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6
        address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one
        of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known.
        In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4
        address alone.
